# BFS vs A* Simulation Tool for Bachelor's Thesis

## Introduction

This Java project serves as a foundational piece for a Bachelor's degree thesis, focusing on the comparison between two prominent pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* (A Star). The goal is to evaluate these algorithms' performance in various multi-target scenarios. Designed for academic research, this tool facilitates simulations, collects and analyzes data, and visually demonstrates algorithmic behaviors in solving pathfinding problems.

## Features

- **Algorithm Simulation**: Implements BFS and A* algorithms to navigate through predefined scenarios.
- **Multi-Target Support**: Capable of handling scenarios with multiple targets to challenge the pathfinding solutions.
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Gathers performance metrics from simulations to provide a quantitative comparison between the algorithms.
- **Visualization Mode**: Offers an interactive visual representation of the algorithms at work, enhancing comprehension of their strategies.
- **Statistical Reporting**: Exports collected data to CSV format for comprehensive analysis, supporting the thesis's research findings.
